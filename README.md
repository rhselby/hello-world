just another diy respository
Hi!

I have a Geeetech Delta Mini G2s 3D Printer similar to the Rostock Delta 3D Printer that I am trying to use Microsoft's 3DPrint universal driver to enable Microsoft's Windows 10 "3D Builder" to print on my printer. Being a Delta printer it prints in a cylinder instead of a cube. The cylinder radius is 100 mm and height is 205 mm. My printer firmware is a fork of the Marlin firmware with the Delta configuration defined in configuration.h .
